This is the official implementation of [STFExplainer](https://underline.io/lecture/93149-stratified-gnn-explanations-through-sufficient-expansion), accepted by AAAI'24.

## Installation
Set up the Python environment according to requirements.txt. Python 3.8 or above is required.

## Dataset
We provide the synthetic dataset, namely BAHierarchicalShapes2p, along with experimental code from data processing to quantitative analysis. 
Other datasets can be obtained from their official homepages.

## Experiments
### running quantitative experiment for baseline explainers
```
sh run_baselines.sh
```
Edit `run_baselines.sh` to reproduce our example baselines (gnnexplainer and pgexplainer).
The results will be included in file `baseline_results.txt`.
More baselines can be found in their official codebases.


### running quantitative experiment for our STFExplainer
```
sh run_stfexplainer.sh
```
The results will be included in file `/STFExplainer/crossv/`
